This programming assignment has been run using Python 3.6.5 distributed by Anaconda, so it is advisable to run with Python 3.6.

The python script to execute is named "amc1354_ads798_sol_script.py", and it can be run simply by running on the terminal the command:
    
    python amc1354_ads798_sol_script.py
    
assuming the command "python" prompts Python 3.6.
    
The scripts assume that the datasets "spambasetrain.csv" and "spambasetest.csv" are in the same folder where the executable
script - namely "amc1354_ads798_sol_script.py" - is.

Executing the script prints on the terminal the answers to the questions 1. to 8., pages 7,8 of the assignment.
Furthermore, the script will generate an output file saved in the same working directory named progoutput.txt, which contains
the required output as specified by the assignment on page 7.

We tested the script in two different laptops both running Python 3.6. We did not test it with other distributions and 
versions of Python so, if there are any bugs, please do not hesitate to contact us at amc1354@nyu.edu or ads798@nyu.edu.

Thank you.
